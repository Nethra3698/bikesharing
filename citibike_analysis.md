## Summary

The Analysis focuses on comparing the McDonald's data for NYC and Des Moines, identifying how and where they are located and if their density affects where people travel in a city and in turn if it will affect the usage of bikes. 
To do this I first identified the locations of the stores in each city. In NYC the stores seem to be more closely placed than in Des Moines where they are placed much further apart. On analyzing the population of the two cities it can be seen that NYC has a population ~ 8M while Des Moines has a population that is around ~200K. The drastic difference is one that cannot be unseen and plays an important role in both where and how people go from one place to another and how many people may use bikes. A fact to remember is that in both the cities there are only 11 store but the way they are placed and the population they are placed in is what makes the difference. 

Next the end locations of bike riders is analysed. At least, 1/4th of these locations are near the McDonald's in NYC  which is an interesting result. This can come to show that with such a huge population density and only 11 McDonald's, a larger number of people would be attracted to the each store and hence this would have an effect on the bike riders and the people coming to that area. But the question remains if this would produce the same result in Des Moines, since it has a small population. In fact a change or effect on the bike riders or people coming to a particular area will most probably not be seen because of the small population and if seen it will be small. So yes, at the end it does depend on the density. 

Lastly, though McDonald's was the factor that was looked over here this is not the only one factor and we need additional factors to see the full picture. Like other than the population and the restaurants, factors like tourist attractions might be necessary to look at to understand if a bike system might work in the city and how it can be implemented. Since Des Moines looks like a pretty spread out city contrary to NYC most riders might be looking for longer riders rather than shorter ones. This can also be justified by the placement of the McDonald's which makes it seem like everything in the city is pretty far off.
